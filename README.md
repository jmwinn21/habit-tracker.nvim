# Habit Tracker

A neovim plugin for tracking habits, similar to the ideas in the Bullet Journal.

Add, remove, update habits
Add or remove instances of habits
Eventually graph your habits like a Github contribution graph

Uses [bookmarks.nvim](https://github.com/heilgar/bookmarks.nvim) as a reference for some implementation details (SQLite3, etc)
